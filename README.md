# SSMSMint | SSMS 19, SSMS 20, SSMS 21 Productivity Addin
An SSMS plugin that streamlines SQL development with workflow enhancements.

As a SQL developer, I've encountered many of the shortcomings and limitations of SSMS. Looking for an opportunity to practice C#, I decided to create a tool that addresses the issues I personally faced. 
I realize there may already be both free and paid tools out there that solve similar problems in one way or another. However, my main interest is in practicing C#, writing code, solving challenges on my own, and building something that helps me in everyday work. 
Iâ€™ll be happy if others also find this tool as useful as I do.
